This folder contains all the code used to perform the spatial simulations. The file `run_seed.py` was used to run the spatial simulations for each mito. The file `generate_av.py` generates the average over the different trials. The file `loop_atp.py` calculates the slope of the curve # ATP molecules vs time and gives the rate of ATP production. Fig. 8B in the paper was generated with the script `av_2x2_m2.py`. The script `plot_slopes.py` generates Fig 8C.
